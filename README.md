- **Dagshub Collaboration:** Leverage Dagshub for version control, collaboration, and tracking changes across machine learning projects.
- **AWS S3 Integration:** Store and retrieve artifacts, datasets, and model artifacts using AWS S3, ensuring scalability, durability, and accessibility.
- **MLOps Best Practices:** Follow MLOps best practices to streamline the machine learning lifecycle, including model development, deployment, and monitoring.
- **Demonstration Project:** Machine learning project is provided to demonstrate the deployment pipeline using the aforementioned technologies.

## Getting Started
To get started with deploying your machine learning project using MLOps and MLFlow, follow these steps:

- Clone this repository to your local machine:

```console
git clone https://github.com/molgorithmo/Deployment-with-MLOps-and-MLFlow.git
```

- Install the necessary dependencies. You may use virtual environments or containerization tools like Docker to manage dependencies cleanly.

- Set up your MLFlow tracking server and configure the environment variables accordingly.

- Connect your project to Dagshub to enable version control and collaboration features.

- Configure AWS S3 credentials and bucket to store artifacts and datasets.

- Customize the sample machine learning project or integrate the provided deployment pipeline into your existing project.

- Run the deployment pipeline and monitor the progress using MLFlow UI and Dagshub.
